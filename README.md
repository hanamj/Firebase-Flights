# Firebase-Flights

### Todo:
- Figure out why sometimes the 'range' polygon gets points that are wayyy out of whack
- Build multiple polygon layers, showing range by plane altitude
- Fix polygon not redrawing after being cleared, when script is running (right now requires script restart)
- - Need script event to know when 'distances' object is updated externally
